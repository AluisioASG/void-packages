+BFS - The Brain Fuck Scheduler by Con Kolivas.
+
+Goals.
+
+The goal of the Brain Fuck Scheduler, referred to as BFS from here on, is to
+completely do away with the complex designs of the past for the cpu process
+scheduler and instead implement one that is very simple in basic design.
+The main focus of BFS is to achieve excellent desktop interactivity and
+responsiveness without heuristics and tuning knobs that are difficult to
+understand, impossible to model and predict the effect of, and when tuned to
+one workload cause massive detriment to another.
+
+
+Design summary.
+
+BFS is best described as a single runqueue, O(n) lookup, earliest effective
+virtual deadline first design, loosely based on EEVDF (earliest eligible virtual
+deadline first) and my previous Staircase Deadline scheduler. Each component
+shall be described in order to understand the significance of, and reasoning for
+it. The codebase when the first stable version was released was approximately
+9000 lines less code than the existing mainline linux kernel scheduler (in
+2.6.31). This does not even take into account the removal of documentation and
+the cgroups code that is not used.
+
+Design reasoning.
+
+The single runqueue refers to the queued but not running processes for the
+entire system, regardless of the number of CPUs. The reason for going back to
+a single runqueue design is that once multiple runqueues are introduced,
+per-CPU or otherwise, there will be complex interactions as each runqueue will
+be responsible for the scheduling latency and fairness of the tasks only on its
+own runqueue, and to achieve fairness and low latency across multiple CPUs, any
+advantage in throughput of having CPU local tasks causes other disadvantages.
+This is due to requiring a very complex balancing system to at best achieve some
+semblance of fairness across CPUs and can only maintain relatively low latency
+for tasks bound to the same CPUs, not across them. To increase said fairness
+and latency across CPUs, the advantage of local runqueue locking, which makes
+for better scalability, is lost due to having to grab multiple locks.
+
+A significant feature of BFS is that all accounting is done purely based on CPU
+used and nowhere is sleep time used in any way to determine entitlement or
+interactivity. Interactivity "estimators" that use some kind of sleep/run
+algorithm are doomed to fail to detect all interactive tasks, and to falsely tag
+tasks that aren't interactive as being so. The reason for this is that it is
+close to impossible to determine that when a task is sleeping, whether it is
+doing it voluntarily, as in a userspace application waiting for input in the
+form of a mouse click or otherwise, or involuntarily, because it is waiting for
+another thread, process, I/O, kernel activity or whatever. Thus, such an
+estimator will introduce corner cases, and more heuristics will be required to
+cope with those corner cases, introducing more corner cases and failed
+interactivity detection and so on. Interactivity in BFS is built into the design
+by virtue of the fact that tasks that are waking up have not used up their quota
+of CPU time, and have earlier effective deadlines, thereby making it very likely
+they will preempt any CPU bound task of equivalent nice level. See below for
+more information on the virtual deadline mechanism. Even if they do not preempt
+a running task, because the rr interval is guaranteed to have a bound upper
+limit on how long a task will wait for, it will be scheduled within a timeframe
+that will not cause visible interface jitter.
+
+
+Design details.
+
+Task insertion.
+
+BFS inserts tasks into each relevant queue as an O(1) insertion into a double
+linked list. On insertion, *every* running queue is checked to see if the newly
+queued task can run on any idle queue, or preempt the lowest running task on the
+system. This is how the cross-CPU scheduling of BFS achieves significantly lower
+latency per extra CPU the system has. In this case the lookup is, in the worst
+case scenario, O(n) where n is the number of CPUs on the system.
+
+Data protection.
+
+BFS has one single lock protecting the process local data of every task in the
+global queue. Thus every insertion, removal and modification of task data in the
+global runqueue needs to grab the global lock. However, once a task is taken by
+a CPU, the CPU has its own local data copy of the running process' accounting
+information which only that CPU accesses and modifies (such as during a
+timer tick) thus allowing the accounting data to be updated lockless. Once a
+CPU has taken a task to run, it removes it from the global queue. Thus the
+global queue only ever has, at most,
+
+	(number of tasks requesting cpu time) - (number of logical CPUs) + 1
+
+tasks in the global queue. This value is relevant for the time taken to look up
+tasks during scheduling. This will increase if many tasks with CPU affinity set
+in their policy to limit which CPUs they're allowed to run on if they outnumber
+the number of CPUs. The +1 is because when rescheduling a task, the CPU's
+currently running task is put back on the queue. Lookup will be described after
+the virtual deadline mechanism is explained.
+
+Virtual deadline.
+
+The key to achieving low latency, scheduling fairness, and "nice level"
+distribution in BFS is entirely in the virtual deadline mechanism. The one
+tunable in BFS is the rr_interval, or "round robin interval". This is the
+maximum time two SCHED_OTHER (or SCHED_NORMAL, the common scheduling policy)
+tasks of the same nice level will be running for, or looking at it the other
+way around, the longest duration two tasks of the same nice level will be
+delayed for. When a task requests cpu time, it is given a quota (time_slice)
+equal to the rr_interval and a virtual deadline. The virtual deadline is
+offset from the current time in jiffies by this equation:
+
+	jiffies + (prio_ratio * rr_interval)
+
+The prio_ratio is determined as a ratio compared to the baseline of nice -20
+and increases by 10% per nice level. The deadline is a virtual one only in that
+no guarantee is placed that a task will actually be scheduled by this time, but
+it is used to compare which task should go next. There are three components to
+how a task is next chosen. First is time_slice expiration. If a task runs out
+of its time_slice, it is descheduled, the time_slice is refilled, and the
+deadline reset to that formula above. Second is sleep, where a task no longer
+is requesting CPU for whatever reason. The time_slice and deadline are _not_
+adjusted in this case and are just carried over for when the task is next
+scheduled. Third is preemption, and that is when a newly waking task is deemed
+higher priority than a currently running task on any cpu by virtue of the fact
+that it has an earlier virtual deadline than the currently running task. The
+earlier deadline is the key to which task is next chosen for the first and
+second cases. Once a task is descheduled, it is put back on the queue, and an
+O(n) lookup of all queued-but-not-running tasks is done to determine which has
+the earliest deadline and that task is chosen to receive CPU next.
+
+The CPU proportion of different nice tasks works out to be approximately the
+
+	(prio_ratio difference)^2
+
+The reason it is squared is that a task's deadline does not change while it is
+running unless it runs out of time_slice. Thus, even if the time actually
+passes the deadline of another task that is queued, it will not get CPU time
+unless the current running task deschedules, and the time "base" (jiffies) is
+constantly moving.
+
+Task lookup.
+
+BFS has 103 priority queues. 100 of these are dedicated to the static priority
+of realtime tasks, and the remaining 3 are, in order of best to worst priority,
+SCHED_ISO (isochronous), SCHED_NORMAL, and SCHED_IDLEPRIO (idle priority
+scheduling). When a task of these priorities is queued, a bitmap of running
+priorities is set showing which of these priorities has tasks waiting for CPU
+time. When a CPU is made to reschedule, the lookup for the next task to get
+CPU time is performed in the following way:
+
+First the bitmap is checked to see what static priority tasks are queued. If
+any realtime priorities are found, the corresponding queue is checked and the
+first task listed there is taken (provided CPU affinity is suitable) and lookup
+is complete. If the priority corresponds to a SCHED_ISO task, they are also
+taken in FIFO order (as they behave like SCHED_RR). If the priority corresponds
+to either SCHED_NORMAL or SCHED_IDLEPRIO, then the lookup becomes O(n). At this
+stage, every task in the runlist that corresponds to that priority is checked
+to see which has the earliest set deadline, and (provided it has suitable CPU
+affinity) it is taken off the runqueue and given the CPU. If a task has an
+expired deadline, it is taken and the rest of the lookup aborted (as they are
+chosen in FIFO order).
+
+Thus, the lookup is O(n) in the worst case only, where n is as described
+earlier, as tasks may be chosen before the whole task list is looked over.
+
+
+Scalability.
+
+The major limitations of BFS will be that of scalability, as the separate
+runqueue designs will have less lock contention as the number of CPUs rises.
+However they do not scale linearly even with separate runqueues as multiple
+runqueues will need to be locked concurrently on such designs to be able to
+achieve fair CPU balancing, to try and achieve some sort of nice-level fairness
+across CPUs, and to achieve low enough latency for tasks on a busy CPU when
+other CPUs would be more suited. BFS has the advantage that it requires no
+balancing algorithm whatsoever, as balancing occurs by proxy simply because
+all CPUs draw off the global runqueue, in priority and deadline order. Despite
+the fact that scalability is _not_ the prime concern of BFS, it both shows very
+good scalability to smaller numbers of CPUs and is likely a more scalable design
+at these numbers of CPUs.
+
+It also has some very low overhead scalability features built into the design
+when it has been deemed their overhead is so marginal that they're worth adding.
+The first is the local copy of the running process' data to the CPU it's running
+on to allow that data to be updated lockless where possible. Then there is
+deference paid to the last CPU a task was running on, by trying that CPU first
+when looking for an idle CPU to use the next time it's scheduled. Finally there
+is the notion of cache locality beyond the last running CPU. The sched_domains
+information is used to determine the relative virtual "cache distance" that
+other CPUs have from the last CPU a task was running on. CPUs with shared
+caches, such as SMT siblings, or multicore CPUs with shared caches, are treated
+as cache local. CPUs without shared caches are treated as not cache local, and
+CPUs on different NUMA nodes are treated as very distant. This "relative cache
+distance" is used by modifying the virtual deadline value when doing lookups.
+Effectively, the deadline is unaltered between "cache local" CPUs, doubled for
+"cache distant" CPUs, and quadrupled for "very distant" CPUs. The reasoning
+behind the doubling of deadlines is as follows. The real cost of migrating a
+task from one CPU to another is entirely dependant on the cache footprint of
+the task, how cache intensive the task is, how long it's been running on that
+CPU to take up the bulk of its cache, how big the CPU cache is, how fast and
+how layered the CPU cache is, how fast a context switch is... and so on. In
+other words, it's close to random in the real world where we do more than just
+one sole workload. The only thing we can be sure of is that it's not free. So
+BFS uses the principle that an idle CPU is a wasted CPU and utilising idle CPUs
+is more important than cache locality, and cache locality only plays a part
+after that. Doubling the effective deadline is based on the premise that the
+"cache local" CPUs will tend to work on the same tasks up to double the number
+of cache local CPUs, and once the workload is beyond that amount, it is likely
+that none of the tasks are cache warm anywhere anyway. The quadrupling for NUMA
+is a value I pulled out of my arse.
+
+When choosing an idle CPU for a waking task, the cache locality is determined
+according to where the task last ran and then idle CPUs are ranked from best
+to worst to choose the most suitable idle CPU based on cache locality, NUMA
+node locality and hyperthread sibling business. They are chosen in the
+following preference (if idle):
+
+* Same core, idle or busy cache, idle threads
+* Other core, same cache, idle or busy cache, idle threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+* Same core, busy threads.
+* Other core, same cache, busy threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, busy threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, busy threads.
+
+This shows the SMT or "hyperthread" awareness in the design as well which will
+choose a real idle core first before a logical SMT sibling which already has
+tasks on the physical CPU.
+
+Early benchmarking of BFS suggested scalability dropped off at the 16 CPU mark.
+However this benchmarking was performed on an earlier design that was far less
+scalable than the current one so it's hard to know how scalable it is in terms
+of both CPUs (due to the global runqueue) and heavily loaded machines (due to
+O(n) lookup) at this stage. Note that in terms of scalability, the number of
+_logical_ CPUs matters, not the number of _physical_ CPUs. Thus, a dual (2x)
+quad core (4X) hyperthreaded (2X) machine is effectively a 16X. Newer benchmark
+results are very promising indeed, without needing to tweak any knobs, features
+or options. Benchmark contributions are most welcome.
+
+
+Features
+
+As the initial prime target audience for BFS was the average desktop user, it
+was designed to not need tweaking, tuning or have features set to obtain benefit
+from it. Thus the number of knobs and features has been kept to an absolute
+minimum and should not require extra user input for the vast majority of cases.
+There are precisely 2 tunables, and 2 extra scheduling policies. The rr_interval
+and iso_cpu tunables, and the SCHED_ISO and SCHED_IDLEPRIO policies. In addition
+to this, BFS also uses sub-tick accounting. What BFS does _not_ now feature is
+support for CGROUPS. The average user should neither need to know what these
+are, nor should they need to be using them to have good desktop behaviour.
+
+rr_interval
+
+There is only one "scheduler" tunable, the round robin interval. This can be
+accessed in
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/rr_interval
+
+The value is in milliseconds, and the default value is set to 6 on a
+uniprocessor machine, and automatically set to a progressively higher value on
+multiprocessor machines. The reasoning behind increasing the value on more CPUs
+is that the effective latency is decreased by virtue of there being more CPUs on
+BFS (for reasons explained above), and increasing the value allows for less
+cache contention and more throughput. Valid values are from 1 to 1000
+Decreasing the value will decrease latencies at the cost of decreasing
+throughput, while increasing it will improve throughput, but at the cost of
+worsening latencies. The accuracy of the rr interval is limited by HZ resolution
+of the kernel configuration. Thus, the worst case latencies are usually slightly
+higher than this actual value. The default value of 6 is not an arbitrary one.
+It is based on the fact that humans can detect jitter at approximately 7ms, so
+aiming for much lower latencies is pointless under most circumstances. It is
+worth noting this fact when comparing the latency performance of BFS to other
+schedulers. Worst case latencies being higher than 7ms are far worse than
+average latencies not being in the microsecond range.
+
+Isochronous scheduling.
+
+Isochronous scheduling is a unique scheduling policy designed to provide
+near-real-time performance to unprivileged (ie non-root) users without the
+ability to starve the machine indefinitely. Isochronous tasks (which means
+"same time") are set using, for example, the schedtool application like so:
+
+	schedtool -I -e amarok
+
+This will start the audio application "amarok" as SCHED_ISO. How SCHED_ISO works
+is that it has a priority level between true realtime tasks and SCHED_NORMAL
+which would allow them to preempt all normal tasks, in a SCHED_RR fashion (ie,
+if multiple SCHED_ISO tasks are running, they purely round robin at rr_interval
+rate). However if ISO tasks run for more than a tunable finite amount of time,
+they are then demoted back to SCHED_NORMAL scheduling. This finite amount of
+time is the percentage of _total CPU_ available across the machine, configurable
+as a percentage in the following "resource handling" tunable (as opposed to a
+scheduler tunable):
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/iso_cpu
+
+and is set to 70% by default. It is calculated over a rolling 5 second average
+Because it is the total CPU available, it means that on a multi CPU machine, it
+is possible to have an ISO task running as realtime scheduling indefinitely on
+just one CPU, as the other CPUs will be available. Setting this to 100 is the
+equivalent of giving all users SCHED_RR access and setting it to 0 removes the
+ability to run any pseudo-realtime tasks.
+
+A feature of BFS is that it detects when an application tries to obtain a
+realtime policy (SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO) and the caller does not have the
+appropriate privileges to use those policies. When it detects this, it will
+give the task SCHED_ISO policy instead. Thus it is transparent to the user.
+Because some applications constantly set their policy as well as their nice
+level, there is potential for them to undo the override specified by the user
+on the command line of setting the policy to SCHED_ISO. To counter this, once
+a task has been set to SCHED_ISO policy, it needs superuser privileges to set
+it back to SCHED_NORMAL. This will ensure the task remains ISO and all child
+processes and threads will also inherit the ISO policy.
+
+Idleprio scheduling.
+
+Idleprio scheduling is a scheduling policy designed to give out CPU to a task
+_only_ when the CPU would be otherwise idle. The idea behind this is to allow
+ultra low priority tasks to be run in the background that have virtually no
+effect on the foreground tasks. This is ideally suited to distributed computing
+clients (like setiathome, folding, mprime etc) but can also be used to start
+a video encode or so on without any slowdown of other tasks. To avoid this
+policy from grabbing shared resources and holding them indefinitely, if it
+detects a state where the task is waiting on I/O, the machine is about to
+suspend to ram and so on, it will transiently schedule them as SCHED_NORMAL. As
+per the Isochronous task management, once a task has been scheduled as IDLEPRIO,
+it cannot be put back to SCHED_NORMAL without superuser privileges. Tasks can
+be set to start as SCHED_IDLEPRIO with the schedtool command like so:
+
+	schedtool -D -e ./mprime
+
+Subtick accounting.
+
+It is surprisingly difficult to get accurate CPU accounting, and in many cases,
+the accounting is done by simply determining what is happening at the precise
+moment a timer tick fires off. This becomes increasingly inaccurate as the
+timer tick frequency (HZ) is lowered. It is possible to create an application
+which uses almost 100% CPU, yet by being descheduled at the right time, records
+zero CPU usage. While the main problem with this is that there are possible
+security implications, it is also difficult to determine how much CPU a task
+really does use. BFS tries to use the sub-tick accounting from the TSC clock,
+where possible, to determine real CPU usage. This is not entirely reliable, but
+is far more likely to produce accurate CPU usage data than the existing designs
+and will not show tasks as consuming no CPU usage when they actually are. Thus,
+the amount of CPU reported as being used by BFS will more accurately represent
+how much CPU the task itself is using (as is shown for example by the 'time'
+application), so the reported values may be quite different to other schedulers.
+Values reported as the 'load' are more prone to problems with this design, but
+per process values are closer to real usage. When comparing throughput of BFS
+to other designs, it is important to compare the actual completed work in terms
+of total wall clock time taken and total work done, rather than the reported
+"cpu usage".

+MuQSS - The Multiple Queue Skiplist Scheduler by Con Kolivas.
+
+MuQSS is a per-cpu runqueue variant of the original BFS scheduler with
+one 8 level skiplist per runqueue, and fine grained locking for much more
+scalability.
+
+
+Goals.
+
+The goal of the Multiple Queue Skiplist Scheduler, referred to as MuQSS from
+here on (pronounced mux) is to completely do away with the complex designs of
+the past for the cpu process scheduler and instead implement one that is very
+simple in basic design. The main focus of MuQSS is to achieve excellent desktop
+interactivity and responsiveness without heuristics and tuning knobs that are
+difficult to understand, impossible to model and predict the effect of, and when
+tuned to one workload cause massive detriment to another, while still being
+scalable to many CPUs and processes.
+
+
+Design summary.
+
+MuQSS is best described as per-cpu multiple runqueue, O(log n) insertion, O(1)
+lookup, earliest effective virtual deadline first tickless design, loosely based
+on EEVDF (earliest eligible virtual deadline first) and my previous Staircase
+Deadline scheduler, and evolved from the single runqueue O(n) BFS scheduler.
+Each component shall be described in order to understand the significance of,
+and reasoning for it.
+
+
+Design reasoning.
+
+In BFS, the use of a single runqueue across all CPUs meant that each CPU would
+need to scan the entire runqueue looking for the process with the earliest
+deadline and schedule that next, regardless of which CPU it originally came
+from. This made BFS deterministic with respect to latency and provided
+guaranteed latencies dependent on number of processes and CPUs. The single
+runqueue, however, meant that all CPUs would compete for the single lock
+protecting it, which would lead to increasing lock contention as the number of
+CPUs rose and appeared to limit scalability of common workloads beyond 16
+logical CPUs. Additionally, the O(n) lookup of the runqueue list obviously
+increased overhead proportionate to the number of queued proecesses and led to
+cache thrashing while iterating over the linked list.
+
+MuQSS is an evolution of BFS, designed to maintain the same scheduling
+decision mechanism and be virtually deterministic without relying on the
+constrained design of the single runqueue by splitting out the single runqueue
+to be per-CPU and use skiplists instead of linked lists.
+
+The original reason for going back to a single runqueue design for BFS was that
+once multiple runqueues are introduced, per-CPU or otherwise, there will be
+complex interactions as each runqueue will be responsible for the scheduling
+latency and fairness of the tasks only on its own runqueue, and to achieve
+fairness and low latency across multiple CPUs, any advantage in throughput of
+having CPU local tasks causes other disadvantages. This is due to requiring a
+very complex balancing system to at best achieve some semblance of fairness
+across CPUs and can only maintain relatively low latency for tasks bound to the
+same CPUs, not across them. To increase said fairness and latency across CPUs,
+the advantage of local runqueue locking, which makes for better scalability, is
+lost due to having to grab multiple locks.
+
+MuQSS works around the problems inherent in multiple runqueue designs by
+making its skip lists priority ordered and through novel use of lockless
+examination of each other runqueue it can decide if it should take the earliest
+deadline task from another runqueue for latency reasons, or for CPU balancing
+reasons. It still does not have a balancing system, choosing to allow the
+next task scheduling decision and task wakeup CPU choice to allow balancing to
+happen by virtue of its choices.
+
+
+Design details.
+
+Custom skip list implementation:
+
+To avoid the overhead of building up and tearing down skip list structures,
+the variant used by MuQSS has a number of optimisations making it specific for
+its use case in the scheduler. It uses static arrays of 8 'levels' instead of
+building up and tearing down structures dynamically. This makes each runqueue
+only scale O(log N) up to 64k tasks. However as there is one runqueue per CPU
+it means that it scales O(log N) up to 64k x number of logical CPUs which is
+far beyond the realistic task limits each CPU could handle. By being 8 levels
+it also makes the array exactly one cacheline in size. Additionally, each
+skip list node is bidirectional making insertion and removal amortised O(1),
+being O(k) where k is 1-8. Uniquely, we are only ever interested in the very
+first entry in each list at all times with MuQSS, so there is never a need to
+do a search and thus look up is always O(1). In interactive mode, the queues
+will be searched beyond their first entry if the first task is not suitable
+for affinity or SMT nice reasons.
+
+Task insertion:
+
+MuQSS inserts tasks into a per CPU runqueue as an O(log N) insertion into
+a custom skip list as described above (based on the original design by William
+Pugh). Insertion is ordered in such a way that there is never a need to do a
+search by ordering tasks according to static priority primarily, and then
+virtual deadline at the time of insertion.
+
+Niffies:
+
+Niffies are a monotonic forward moving timer not unlike the "jiffies" but are
+of nanosecond resolution. Niffies are calculated per-runqueue from the high
+resolution TSC timers, and in order to maintain fairness are synchronised
+between CPUs whenever both runqueues are locked concurrently.
+
+Virtual deadline:
+
+The key to achieving low latency, scheduling fairness, and "nice level"
+distribution in MuQSS is entirely in the virtual deadline mechanism. The one
+tunable in MuQSS is the rr_interval, or "round robin interval". This is the
+maximum time two SCHED_OTHER (or SCHED_NORMAL, the common scheduling policy)
+tasks of the same nice level will be running for, or looking at it the other
+way around, the longest duration two tasks of the same nice level will be
+delayed for. When a task requests cpu time, it is given a quota (time_slice)
+equal to the rr_interval and a virtual deadline. The virtual deadline is
+offset from the current time in niffies by this equation:
+
+	niffies + (prio_ratio * rr_interval)
+
+The prio_ratio is determined as a ratio compared to the baseline of nice -20
+and increases by 10% per nice level. The deadline is a virtual one only in that
+no guarantee is placed that a task will actually be scheduled by this time, but
+it is used to compare which task should go next. There are three components to
+how a task is next chosen. First is time_slice expiration. If a task runs out
+of its time_slice, it is descheduled, the time_slice is refilled, and the
+deadline reset to that formula above. Second is sleep, where a task no longer
+is requesting CPU for whatever reason. The time_slice and deadline are _not_
+adjusted in this case and are just carried over for when the task is next
+scheduled. Third is preemption, and that is when a newly waking task is deemed
+higher priority than a currently running task on any cpu by virtue of the fact
+that it has an earlier virtual deadline than the currently running task. The
+earlier deadline is the key to which task is next chosen for the first and
+second cases.
+
+The CPU proportion of different nice tasks works out to be approximately the
+
+	(prio_ratio difference)^2
+
+The reason it is squared is that a task's deadline does not change while it is
+running unless it runs out of time_slice. Thus, even if the time actually
+passes the deadline of another task that is queued, it will not get CPU time
+unless the current running task deschedules, and the time "base" (niffies) is
+constantly moving.
+
+Task lookup:
+
+As tasks are already pre-ordered according to anticipated scheduling order in
+the skip lists, lookup for the next suitable task per-runqueue is always a
+matter of simply selecting the first task in the 0th level skip list entry.
+In order to maintain optimal latency and fairness across CPUs, MuQSS does a
+novel examination of every other runqueue in cache locality order, choosing the
+best task across all runqueues. This provides near-determinism of how long any
+task across the entire system may wait before receiving CPU time. The other
+runqueues are first examine lockless and then trylocked to minimise the
+potential lock contention if they are likely to have a suitable better task.
+Each other runqueue lock is only held for as long as it takes to examine the
+entry for suitability. In "interactive" mode, the default setting, MuQSS will
+look for the best deadline task across all CPUs, while in !interactive mode,
+it will only select a better deadline task from another CPU if it is more
+heavily laden than the current one.
+
+Lookup is therefore O(k) where k is number of CPUs.
+
+
+Latency.
+
+Through the use of virtual deadlines to govern the scheduling order of normal
+tasks, queue-to-activation latency per runqueue is guaranteed to be bound by
+the rr_interval tunable which is set to 6ms by default. This means that the
+longest a CPU bound task will wait for more CPU is proportional to the number
+of running tasks and in the common case of 0-2 running tasks per CPU, will be
+under the 7ms threshold for human perception of jitter. Additionally, as newly
+woken tasks will have an early deadline from their previous runtime, the very
+tasks that are usually latency sensitive will have the shortest interval for
+activation, usually preempting any existing CPU bound tasks.
+
+Tickless expiry:
+
+A feature of MuQSS is that it is not tied to the resolution of the chosen tick
+rate in Hz, instead depending entirely on the high resolution timers where
+possible for sub-millisecond accuracy on timeouts regarless of the underlying
+tick rate. This allows MuQSS to be run with the low overhead of low Hz rates
+such as 100 by default, benefiting from the improved throughput and lower
+power usage it provides. Another advantage of this approach is that in
+combination with the Full No HZ option, which disables ticks on running task
+CPUs instead of just idle CPUs, the tick can be disabled at all times
+regardless of how many tasks are running instead of being limited to just one
+running task. Note that this option is NOT recommended for regular desktop
+users.
+
+
+Scalability and balancing.
+
+Unlike traditional approaches where balancing is a combination of CPU selection
+at task wakeup and intermittent balancing based on a vast array of rules set
+according to architecture, busyness calculations and special case management,
+MuQSS indirectly balances on the fly at task wakeup and next task selection.
+During initialisation, MuQSS creates a cache coherency ordered list of CPUs for
+each logical CPU and uses this to aid task/CPU selection when CPUs are busy.
+Additionally it selects any idle CPUs, if they are available, at any time over
+busy CPUs according to the following preference:
+
+ * Same thread, idle or busy cache, idle or busy threads
+ * Other core, same cache, idle or busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Other core, same cache, busy threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, busy threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, busy threads.
+
+Mux is therefore SMT, MC and Numa aware without the need for extra
+intermittent balancing to maintain CPUs busy and make the most of cache
+coherency.
+
+
+Features
+
+As the initial prime target audience for MuQSS was the average desktop user, it
+was designed to not need tweaking, tuning or have features set to obtain benefit
+from it. Thus the number of knobs and features has been kept to an absolute
+minimum and should not require extra user input for the vast majority of cases.
+There are 3 optional tunables, and 2 extra scheduling policies. The rr_interval,
+interactive, and iso_cpu tunables, and the SCHED_ISO and SCHED_IDLEPRIO
+policies. In addition to this, MuQSS also uses sub-tick accounting. What MuQSS
+does _not_ now feature is support for CGROUPS. The average user should neither
+need to know what these are, nor should they need to be using them to have good
+desktop behaviour. However since some applications refuse to work without
+cgroups, one can enable them with MuQSS as a stub and the filesystem will be
+created which will allow the applications to work.
+
+rr_interval:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/rr_interval
+
+The value is in milliseconds, and the default value is set to 6. Valid values
+are from 1 to 1000 Decreasing the value will decrease latencies at the cost of
+decreasing throughput, while increasing it will improve throughput, but at the
+cost of worsening latencies. It is based on the fact that humans can detect
+jitter at approximately 7ms, so aiming for much lower latencies is pointless
+under most circumstances. It is worth noting this fact when comparing the
+latency performance of MuQSS to other schedulers. Worst case latencies being
+higher than 7ms are far worse than average latencies not being in the
+microsecond range.
+
+interactive:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/interactive
+
+The value is a simple boolean of 1 for on and 0 for off and is set to on by
+default. Disabling this will disable the near-determinism of MuQSS when
+selecting the next task by not examining all CPUs for the earliest deadline
+task, or which CPU to wake to, instead prioritising CPU balancing for improved
+throughput. Latency will still be bound by rr_interval, but on a per-CPU basis
+instead of across the whole system.
+
+Isochronous scheduling:
+
+Isochronous scheduling is a unique scheduling policy designed to provide
+near-real-time performance to unprivileged (ie non-root) users without the
+ability to starve the machine indefinitely. Isochronous tasks (which means
+"same time") are set using, for example, the schedtool application like so:
+
+	schedtool -I -e amarok
+
+This will start the audio application "amarok" as SCHED_ISO. How SCHED_ISO works
+is that it has a priority level between true realtime tasks and SCHED_NORMAL
+which would allow them to preempt all normal tasks, in a SCHED_RR fashion (ie,
+if multiple SCHED_ISO tasks are running, they purely round robin at rr_interval
+rate). However if ISO tasks run for more than a tunable finite amount of time,
+they are then demoted back to SCHED_NORMAL scheduling. This finite amount of
+time is the percentage of CPU available per CPU, configurable as a percentage in
+the following "resource handling" tunable (as opposed to a scheduler tunable):
+
+iso_cpu:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/iso_cpu
+
+and is set to 70% by default. It is calculated over a rolling 5 second average
+Because it is the total CPU available, it means that on a multi CPU machine, it
+is possible to have an ISO task running as realtime scheduling indefinitely on
+just one CPU, as the other CPUs will be available. Setting this to 100 is the
+equivalent of giving all users SCHED_RR access and setting it to 0 removes the
+ability to run any pseudo-realtime tasks.
+
+A feature of MuQSS is that it detects when an application tries to obtain a
+realtime policy (SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO) and the caller does not have the
+appropriate privileges to use those policies. When it detects this, it will
+give the task SCHED_ISO policy instead. Thus it is transparent to the user.
+
+
+Idleprio scheduling:
+
+Idleprio scheduling is a scheduling policy designed to give out CPU to a task
+_only_ when the CPU would be otherwise idle. The idea behind this is to allow
+ultra low priority tasks to be run in the background that have virtually no
+effect on the foreground tasks. This is ideally suited to distributed computing
+clients (like setiathome, folding, mprime etc) but can also be used to start a
+video encode or so on without any slowdown of other tasks. To avoid this policy
+from grabbing shared resources and holding them indefinitely, if it detects a
+state where the task is waiting on I/O, the machine is about to suspend to ram
+and so on, it will transiently schedule them as SCHED_NORMAL. Once a task has
+been scheduled as IDLEPRIO, it cannot be put back to SCHED_NORMAL without
+superuser privileges since it is effectively a lower scheduling policy. Tasks
+can be set to start as SCHED_IDLEPRIO with the schedtool command like so:
+
+schedtool -D -e ./mprime
+
+Subtick accounting:
+
+It is surprisingly difficult to get accurate CPU accounting, and in many cases,
+the accounting is done by simply determining what is happening at the precise
+moment a timer tick fires off. This becomes increasingly inaccurate as the timer
+tick frequency (HZ) is lowered. It is possible to create an application which
+uses almost 100% CPU, yet by being descheduled at the right time, records zero
+CPU usage. While the main problem with this is that there are possible security
+implications, it is also difficult to determine how much CPU a task really does
+use. Mux uses sub-tick accounting from the TSC clock to determine real CPU
+usage. Thus, the amount of CPU reported as being used by MuQSS will more
+accurately represent how much CPU the task itself is using (as is shown for
+example by the 'time' application), so the reported values may be quite
+different to other schedulers. When comparing throughput of MuQSS to other
+designs, it is important to compare the actual completed work in terms of total
+wall clock time taken and total work done, rather than the reported "cpu usage".
+
+Symmetric MultiThreading (SMT) aware nice:
+
+SMT, a.k.a. hyperthreading, is a very common feature on modern CPUs. While the
+logical CPU count rises by adding thread units to each CPU core, allowing more
+than one task to be run simultaneously on the same core, the disadvantage of it
+is that the CPU power is shared between the tasks, not summating to the power
+of two CPUs. The practical upshot of this is that two tasks running on
+separate threads of the same core run significantly slower than if they had one
+core each to run on. While smart CPU selection allows each task to have a core
+to itself whenever available (as is done on MuQSS), it cannot offset the
+slowdown that occurs when the cores are all loaded and only a thread is left.
+Most of the time this is harmless as the CPU is effectively overloaded at this
+point and the extra thread is of benefit. However when running a niced task in
+the presence of an un-niced task (say nice 19 v nice 0), the nice task gets
+precisely the same amount of CPU power as the unniced one. MuQSS has an
+optional configuration feature known as SMT-NICE which selectively idles the
+secondary niced thread for a period proportional to the nice difference,
+allowing CPU distribution according to nice level to be maintained, at the
+expense of a small amount of extra overhead. If this is configured in on a
+machine without SMT threads, the overhead is minimal.

+ * storage performance, we'd have a proportional reduction in IO-wait time.

+ * Imagine for instance the case where two tasks block on one CPU, only the one
+ * CPU will have IO-wait accounted, while the other has regular idle. Even
+ * though, if the storage were faster, both could've ran at the same time,
+ * utilising both CPUs.
+ *
+ * This means, that when looking globally, the current IO-wait accounting on
+ * SMP is a lower bound, by reason of under accounting.
+ *
+ * Worse, since the numbers are provided per CPU, they are sometimes
+ * interpreted per CPU, and that is nonsensical. A blocked task isn't strictly
+ * associated with any one particular CPU, it can wake to another CPU than it

+  Copyright (C) 2011,2016 Con Kolivas.
+
+  Code based on example originally by William Pugh.
+
+Skip Lists are a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees, as
+described in the June 1990 issue of CACM and were invented by
+William Pugh in 1987.
+
+A couple of comments about this implementation:
+The routine randomLevel has been hard-coded to generate random
+levels using p=0.25. It can be easily changed.
+
+The insertion routine has been implemented so as to use the
+dirty hack described in the CACM paper: if a random level is
+generated that is more than the current maximum level, the
+current maximum level plus one is used instead.
+
+Levels start at zero and go up to MaxLevel (which is equal to
+MaxNumberOfLevels-1).
+
+The routines defined in this file are:
+
+init: defines slnode
+
+new_skiplist: returns a new, empty list
+
+randomLevel: Returns a random level based on a u64 random seed passed to it.
+In MuQSS, the "niffy" time is used for this purpose.
+
+insert(l,key, value): inserts the binding (key, value) into l. This operation
+occurs in O(log n) time.
+
+delnode(slnode, l, node): deletes any binding of key from the l based on the
+actual node value. This operation occurs in O(k) time where k is the
+number of levels of the node in question (max 8). The original delete
+function occurred in O(log n) time and involved a search.
+
+MuQSS Notes: In this implementation of skiplists, there are bidirectional
+next/prev pointers and the insert function returns a pointer to the actual
+node the value is stored. The key here is chosen by the scheduler so as to
+sort tasks according to the priority list requirements and is no longer used
+by the scheduler after insertion. The scheduler lookup, however, occurs in
+O(1) time because it is always the first item in the level 0 linked list.
+Since the task struct stores a copy of the node pointer upon skiplist_insert,
+it can also remove it much faster than the original implementation with the
+aid of prev<->next pointer manipulation and no searching.

Subject: [PATCH 17/26] elevator: lookup mq vs non-mq elevators

If an IO scheduler is selected via elevator= and it doesn't match
the driver in question wrt blk-mq support, then we fail to boot.

The elevator= parameter is deprecated and only supported for
non-mq devices. Augment the elevator lookup API so that we
pass in if we're looking for an mq capable scheduler or not,
so that we only ever return a valid type for the queue in
question.

+BFQ has a non-null overhead, which limits the maximum IOPS that a CPU
+can process for a device scheduled with BFQ. To give an idea of the
+limits on slow or average CPUs, here are, first, the limits of bfq-mq
+and bfq for three different CPUs, on, respectively, an average laptop,
+an old desktop, and a cheap embedded system, in case full hierarchical
+support is enabled (i.e., CONFIG_MQ_BFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED is set for
+bfq-mq, or CONFIG_BFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED is set for bfq), but
+CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP is not set (Section 4-2):
+- Intel i7-4850HQ: 400 KIOPS
+- AMD A8-3850: 250 KIOPS
+- ARM CortexTM-A53 Octa-core: 80 KIOPS
+
+As for bfq-sq, it cannot reach the above IOPS, because of the
+inherent, lower parallelism of legacy blk and of the components within
+it (including bfq-sq itself). In particular, results with
+CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP unset are rather fluctuating. The limits
+reported below for the case CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP set will however
+provide a lower bound to the limits of bfq-sq.
+
+Turning back to bfq-mq and bfq, If CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP is set (and
+of course full hierarchical support is enabled), then the sustainable
+throughput with bfq-mq and bfq decreases, because all blkio.bfq*
+statistics are created and updated (Section 4-2).  For bfq-mq and bfq,
+this leads to the following maximum sustainable throughputs, on the
+same systems as above:
+- Intel i7-4850HQ: 310 KIOPS
+- AMD A8-3850: 200 KIOPS
+- ARM CortexTM-A53 Octa-core: 56 KIOPS
+
+Finally, if CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP is set (and full hierarchical
+support is enabled), then bfq-sq exhibits the following limits:
+- Intel i7-4850HQ: 250 KIOPS
+- AMD A8-3850: 170 KIOPS

+As for cgroups-v1 (blkio controller), the exact set of stat files

+	 *
+	 * The blkg_lookup performed in bfq_get_queue, protected

+	 * the original blkg. If this is the case, then the
+	 * bfqg_and_blkg_get performed in bfq_get_queue, to pin down
+	 * the blkg, is useless: it does not prevent blk-cgroup code
+	 * from destroying both the original blkg and all objects
+	 * directly or indirectly referred by the copy of the
+	 * blkg.
+	 *
+	 * On the bright side, destroy operations on a blkg invoke, as
+	 * a first step, hooks of the scheduler associated with the
+	 * blkg. And these hooks are executed with bfqd->lock held for
+	 * BFQ. As a consequence, for any blkg associated with the

+	 * to, we are guaranteed that such a blkg is not destroyed, and
+	 * that all the pointers it contains are consistent, while we
+	 * are holding bfqd->lock. A blkg_lookup performed with
+	 * bfqd->lock held then returns a fully consistent blkg, which
+	 * remains consistent until this lock is held.
+	 *
+	 * Thanks to the last fact, and to the fact that: (1) bfqg has
+	 * been obtained through a blkg_lookup in the above
+	 * assignment, and (2) bfqd->lock is being held, here we can
+	 * safely use the policy data for the involved blkg (i.e., the
+	 * field bfqg->pd) to get to the blkg associated with bfqg,
+	 * and then we can safely use any field of blkg. After we
+	 * release bfqd->lock, even just getting blkg through this
+	 * bfqg may cause dangling references to be traversed, as
+	 * bfqg->pd may not exist any more.
+	 *
+	 * In view of the above facts, here we cache, in the bfqg, any
+	 * blkg data we may need for this bic, and for its associated
+	 * bfq_queue. As of now, we need to cache only the path of the
+	 * blkg, which is used in the bfq_log_* functions.
+	 *
+	 * Finally, note that bfqg itself needs to be protected from
+	 * destruction on the blkg_free of the original blkg (which

+ * file.
+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share I/O scheduler, with some extra
+ * low-latency capabilities. BFQ also supports full hierarchical
+ * scheduling through cgroups. Next paragraphs provide an introduction
+ * on BFQ inner workings. Details on BFQ benefits and usage can be
+ * found in Documentation/block/bfq-iosched.txt.
+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share storage-I/O scheduling algorithm based
+ * on the slice-by-slice service scheme of CFQ. But BFQ assigns
+ * budgets, measured in number of sectors, to processes instead of
+ * time slices. The device is not granted to the in-service process
+ * for a given time slice, but until it has exhausted its assigned
+ * budget. This change from the time to the service domain enables BFQ
+ * to distribute the device throughput among processes as desired,
+ * without any distortion due to throughput fluctuations, or to device
+ * internal queueing. BFQ uses an ad hoc internal scheduler, called
+ * B-WF2Q+, to schedule processes according to their budgets. More
+ * precisely, BFQ schedules queues associated with processes. Thanks to
+ * the accurate policy of B-WF2Q+, BFQ can afford to assign high
+ * budgets to I/O-bound processes issuing sequential requests (to
+ * boost the throughput), and yet guarantee a low latency to
+ * interactive and soft real-time applications.
+ *
+ * NOTE: if the main or only goal, with a given device, is to achieve
+ * the maximum-possible throughput at all times, then do switch off
+ * all low-latency heuristics for that device, by setting low_latency
+ * to 0.
+ *
+ * BFQ is described in [1], where also a reference to the initial, more
+ * theoretical paper on BFQ can be found. The interested reader can find
+ * in the latter paper full details on the main algorithm, as well as
+ * formulas of the guarantees and formal proofs of all the properties.
+ * With respect to the version of BFQ presented in these papers, this
+ * implementation adds a few more heuristics, such as the one that
+ * guarantees a low latency to soft real-time applications, and a
+ * hierarchical extension based on H-WF2Q+.
+ *
+ * B-WF2Q+ is based on WF2Q+, that is described in [2], together with
+ * H-WF2Q+, while the augmented tree used to implement B-WF2Q+ with O(log N)
+ * complexity derives from the one introduced with EEVDF in [3].

+ * In particular, R is the peak rate of the reference device (see below),
+ * and T is a reference time: given the systems that are likely to be
+ * installed on the reference device according to its speed class, T is
+ * about the maximum time needed, under BFQ and while reading two files in
+ * parallel, to load typical large applications on these systems.
+ * In practice, the slower/faster the device at hand is, the more/less it
+ * takes to load applications with respect to the reference device.
+ * Accordingly, the longer/shorter BFQ grants weight raising to interactive
+ * applications.
+ *
+ * BFQ uses four different reference pairs (R, T), depending on:
+ * . whether the device is rotational or non-rotational;
+ * . whether the device is slow, such as old or portable HDDs, as well as
+ *   SD cards, or fast, such as newer HDDs and SSDs.
+ *
+ * The device's speed class is dynamically (re)detected in
+ * bfq_update_peak_rate() every time the estimated peak rate is updated.
+ *
+ * In the following definitions, R_slow[0]/R_fast[0] and

+ * rotational device, whereas R_slow[1]/R_fast[1] and
+ * T_slow[1]/T_fast[1] are the reference values for a slow/fast
+ * non-rotational device. Finally, device_speed_thresh are the
+ * thresholds used to switch between speed classes. The reference
+ * rates are not the actual peak rates of the devices used as a
+ * reference, but slightly lower values. The reason for using these
+ * slightly lower values is that the peak-rate estimator tends to
+ * yield slightly lower values than the actual peak rate (it can yield
+ * the actual peak rate only if there is only one process doing I/O,
+ * and the process does sequential I/O).

+ * If many queues belonging to the same group happen to be created

+ * queues have typically a common goal. In particular, bursts of queue
+ * creations are usually caused by services or applications that spawn
+ * many parallel threads/processes. Examples are systemd during boot,
+ * or git grep. To help these processes get their job done as soon as
+ * possible, it is usually better to not grant either weight-raising
+ * or device idling to their queues.
+ *
+ * In this comment we describe, firstly, the reasons why this fact
+ * holds, and, secondly, the next function, which implements the main
+ * steps needed to properly mark these queues so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way.
+ *
+ * The above services or applications benefit mostly from a high
+ * throughput: the quicker the requests of the activated queues are
+ * cumulatively served, the sooner the target job of these queues gets
+ * completed. As a consequence, weight-raising any of these queues,
+ * which also implies idling the device for it, is almost always
+ * counterproductive. In most cases it just lowers throughput.
+ *
+ * On the other hand, a burst of queue creations may be caused also by
+ * the start of an application that does not consist of a lot of
+ * parallel I/O-bound threads. In fact, with a complex application,
+ * several short processes may need to be executed to start-up the
+ * application. In this respect, to start an application as quickly as
+ * possible, the best thing to do is in any case to privilege the I/O
+ * related to the application with respect to all other
+ * I/O. Therefore, the best strategy to start as quickly as possible
+ * an application that causes a burst of queue creations is to
+ * weight-raise all the queues created during the burst. This is the
+ * exact opposite of the best strategy for the other type of bursts.
+ *
+ * In the end, to take the best action for each of the two cases, the
+ * two types of bursts need to be distinguished. Fortunately, this
+ * seems relatively easy, by looking at the sizes of the bursts. In
+ * particular, we found a threshold such that only bursts with a
+ * larger size than that threshold are apparently caused by
+ * services or commands such as systemd or git grep. For brevity,
+ * hereafter we call just 'large' these bursts. BFQ *does not*
+ * weight-raise queues whose creation occurs in a large burst. In
+ * addition, for each of these queues BFQ performs or does not perform
+ * idling depending on which choice boosts the throughput more. The
+ * exact choice depends on the device and request pattern at
+ * hand.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, false positives may occur while an interactive task
+ * is starting (e.g., an application is being started). The
+ * consequence is that the queues associated with the task do not
+ * enjoy weight raising as expected. Fortunately these false positives
+ * are very rare. They typically occur if some service happens to
+ * start doing I/O exactly when the interactive task starts.
+ *
+ * Turning back to the next function, it implements all the steps
+ * needed to detect the occurrence of a large burst and to properly
+ * mark all the queues belonging to it (so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way). This goal is achieved by maintaining a
+ * "burst list" that holds, temporarily, the queues that belong to the
+ * burst in progress. The list is then used to mark these queues as
+ * belonging to a large burst if the burst does become large. The main
+ * steps are the following.
+ *
+ * . when the very first queue is created, the queue is inserted into the
+ *   list (as it could be the first queue in a possible burst)
+ *
+ * . if the current burst has not yet become large, and a queue Q that does
+ *   not yet belong to the burst is activated shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a new queue entered the burst list, then the function appends
+ *   Q to the burst list
+ *
+ * . if, as a consequence of the previous step, the burst size reaches
+ *   the large-burst threshold, then
+ *
+ *     . all the queues in the burst list are marked as belonging to a
+ *       large burst
+ *
+ *     . the burst list is deleted; in fact, the burst list already served
+ *       its purpose (keeping temporarily track of the queues in a burst,
+ *       so as to be able to mark them as belonging to a large burst in the
+ *       previous sub-step), and now is not needed any more
+ *
+ *     . the device enters a large-burst mode
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created while
+ *   the device is in large-burst mode and shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a queue either entered the burst list or was marked as
+ *   belonging to the current large burst, then Q is immediately marked
+ *   as belonging to a large burst.
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created a while
+ *   later, i.e., not shortly after, than the last time at which a queue
+ *   either entered the burst list or was marked as belonging to the
+ *   current large burst, then the current burst is deemed as finished and:
+ *
+ *        . the large-burst mode is reset if set
+ *
+ *        . the burst list is emptied
+ *
+ *        . Q is inserted in the burst list, as Q may be the first queue
+ *          in a possible new burst (then the burst list contains just Q

+
+/*
+ * The next function, invoked after the input queue bfqq switches from
+ * idle to busy, updates the budget of bfqq. The function also tells
+ * whether the in-service queue should be expired, by returning
+ * true. The purpose of expiring the in-service queue is to give bfqq
+ * the chance to possibly preempt the in-service queue, and the reason
+ * for preempting the in-service queue is to achieve one of the two
+ * goals below.
+ *
+ * 1. Guarantee to bfqq its reserved bandwidth even if bfqq has
+ * expired because it has remained idle. In particular, bfqq may have
+ * expired for one of the following two reasons:
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_NO_MORE_REQUEST bfqq did not enjoy any device idling and
+ *   did not make it to issue a new request before its last request
+ *   was served;
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_TOO_IDLE bfqq did enjoy device idling, but did not issue
+ *   a new request before the expiration of the idling-time.
+ *
+ * Even if bfqq has expired for one of the above reasons, the process
+ * associated with the queue may be however issuing requests greedily,
+ * and thus be sensitive to the bandwidth it receives (bfqq may have
+ * remained idle for other reasons: CPU high load, bfqq not enjoying
+ * idling, I/O throttling somewhere in the path from the process to
+ * the I/O scheduler, ...). But if, after every expiration for one of
+ * the above two reasons, bfqq has to wait for the service of at least
+ * one full budget of another queue before being served again, then
+ * bfqq is likely to get a much lower bandwidth or resource time than
+ * its reserved ones. To address this issue, two countermeasures need
+ * to be taken.
+ *
+ * First, the budget and the timestamps of bfqq need to be updated in
+ * a special way on bfqq reactivation: they need to be updated as if
+ * bfqq did not remain idle and did not expire. In fact, if they are
+ * computed as if bfqq expired and remained idle until reactivation,
+ * then the process associated with bfqq is treated as if, instead of
+ * being greedy, it stopped issuing requests when bfqq remained idle,
+ * and restarts issuing requests only on this reactivation. In other
+ * words, the scheduler does not help the process recover the "service
+ * hole" between bfqq expiration and reactivation. As a consequence,
+ * the process receives a lower bandwidth than its reserved one. In
+ * contrast, to recover this hole, the budget must be updated as if
+ * bfqq was not expired at all before this reactivation, i.e., it must
+ * be set to the value of the remaining budget when bfqq was
+ * expired. Along the same line, timestamps need to be assigned the
+ * value they had the last time bfqq was selected for service, i.e.,
+ * before last expiration. Thus timestamps need to be back-shifted
+ * with respect to their normal computation (see [1] for more details
+ * on this tricky aspect).
+ *
+ * Secondly, to allow the process to recover the hole, the in-service
+ * queue must be expired too, to give bfqq the chance to preempt it
+ * immediately. In fact, if bfqq has to wait for a full budget of the
+ * in-service queue to be completed, then it may become impossible to
+ * let the process recover the hole, even if the back-shifted
+ * timestamps of bfqq are lower than those of the in-service queue. If
+ * this happens for most or all of the holes, then the process may not
+ * receive its reserved bandwidth. In this respect, it is worth noting
+ * that, being the service of outstanding requests unpreemptible, a
+ * little fraction of the holes may however be unrecoverable, thereby
+ * causing a little loss of bandwidth.
+ *
+ * The last important point is detecting whether bfqq does need this
+ * bandwidth recovery. In this respect, the next function deems the
+ * process associated with bfqq greedy, and thus allows it to recover
+ * the hole, if: 1) the process is waiting for the arrival of a new
+ * request (which implies that bfqq expired for one of the above two
+ * reasons), and 2) such a request has arrived soon. The first
+ * condition is controlled through the flag non_blocking_wait_rq,
+ * while the second through the flag arrived_in_time. If both
+ * conditions hold, then the function computes the budget in the
+ * above-described special way, and signals that the in-service queue
+ * should be expired. Timestamp back-shifting is done later in
+ * __bfq_activate_entity.
+ *
+ * 2. Reduce latency. Even if timestamps are not backshifted to let
+ * the process associated with bfqq recover a service hole, bfqq may
+ * however happen to have, after being (re)activated, a lower finish
+ * timestamp than the in-service queue.  That is, the next budget of
+ * bfqq may have to be completed before the one of the in-service
+ * queue. If this is the case, then preempting the in-service queue
+ * allows this goal to be achieved, apart from the unpreemptible,
+ * outstanding requests mentioned above.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, regardless of which of the above two goals one wants
+ * to achieve, service trees need first to be updated to know whether
+ * the in-service queue must be preempted. To have service trees
+ * correctly updated, the in-service queue must be expired and
+ * rescheduled, and bfqq must be scheduled too. This is one of the
+ * most costly operations (in future versions, the scheduling
+ * mechanism may be re-designed in such a way to make it possible to
+ * know whether preemption is needed without needing to update service
+ * trees). In addition, queue preemptions almost always cause random
+ * I/O, and thus loss of throughput. Because of these facts, the next
+ * function adopts the following simple scheme to avoid both costly
+ * operations and too frequent preemptions: it requests the expiration
+ * of the in-service queue (unconditionally) only for queues that need
+ * to recover a hole, or that either are weight-raised or deserve to
+ * be weight-raised.

+ * It is not trivial to estimate the peak rate (correctly): because of
+ * the presence of sw and hw queues between the scheduler and the
+ * device components that finally serve I/O requests, it is hard to
+ * say exactly when a given dispatched request is served inside the
+ * device, and for how long. As a consequence, it is hard to know
+ * precisely at what rate a given set of requests is actually served
+ * by the device.
+ *
+ * On the opposite end, the dispatch time of any request is trivially
+ * available, and, from this piece of information, the "dispatch rate"
+ * of requests can be immediately computed. So, the idea in the next
+ * function is to use what is known, namely request dispatch times
+ * (plus, when useful, request completion times), to estimate what is
+ * unknown, namely in-device request service rate.
+ *
+ * The main issue is that, because of the above facts, the rate at
+ * which a certain set of requests is dispatched over a certain time
+ * interval can vary greatly with respect to the rate at which the
+ * same requests are then served. But, since the size of any
+ * intermediate queue is limited, and the service scheme is lossless
+ * (no request is silently dropped), the following obvious convergence

+ * previous one has been completed). This makes it hard to evaluate
+ * the real rate at which the I/O requests of each bfq_queue are
+ * served.  In fact, for an I/O scheduler like BFQ, serving a
+ * bfq_queue means just dispatching its requests during its service
+ * slot (i.e., until the budget of the queue is exhausted, or the
+ * queue remains idle, or, finally, a timeout fires). But, during the
+ * service slot of a bfq_queue, around 100 ms at most, the device may
+ * be even still processing requests of bfq_queues served in previous
+ * service slots. On the opposite end, the requests of the in-service
+ * bfq_queue may be completed after the service slot of the queue
+ * finishes.
+ *
+ * Anyway, unless more sophisticated solutions are used
+ * (where possible), the sum of the sizes of the requests dispatched
+ * during the service slot of a bfq_queue is probably the only
+ * approximation available for the service received by the bfq_queue
+ * during its service slot. And this sum is the quantity used in this

+ * that, if the next request of the application does not arrive before
+ * soft_rt_next_start, then the above requirement on the bandwidth is met.
+ *
+ * The second requirement is that the request pattern of the application is
+ * isochronous, i.e., that, after issuing a request or a batch of requests,
+ * the application stops issuing new requests until all its pending requests
+ * have been completed. After that, the application may issue a new batch,
+ * and so on.
+ * For this reason the next function is invoked to compute
+ * soft_rt_next_start only for applications that meet this requirement,
+ * whereas soft_rt_next_start is set to infinity for applications that do
+ * not.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, even a greedy application may happen to behave in an
+ * isochronous way if the CPU load is high. In fact, the application may
+ * stop issuing requests while the CPUs are busy serving other processes,
+ * then restart, then stop again for a while, and so on. In addition, if
+ * the disk achieves a low enough throughput with the request pattern
+ * issued by the application (e.g., because the request pattern is random
+ * and/or the device is slow), then the application may meet the above
+ * bandwidth requirement too. To prevent such a greedy application to be
+ * deemed as soft real-time, a further rule is used in the computation of
+ * soft_rt_next_start: soft_rt_next_start must be higher than the current
+ * time plus the maximum time for which the arrival of a request is waited
+ * for when a sync queue becomes idle, namely bfqd->bfq_slice_idle.
+ * This filters out greedy applications, as the latter issue instead their
+ * next request as soon as possible after the last one has been completed
+ * (in contrast, when a batch of requests is completed, a soft real-time
+ * application spends some time processing data).
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, the last filter may easily generate false positives if
+ * only bfqd->bfq_slice_idle is used as a reference time interval and one
+ * or both the following cases occur:
+ * 1) HZ is so low that the duration of a jiffy is comparable to or higher
+ *    than bfqd->bfq_slice_idle. This happens, e.g., on slow devices with
+ *    HZ=100.
+ * 2) jiffies, instead of increasing at a constant rate, may stop increasing
+ *    for a while, then suddenly 'jump' by several units to recover the lost
+ *    increments. This seems to happen, e.g., inside virtual machines.
+ * To address this issue, we do not use as a reference time interval just
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, but bfqd->bfq_slice_idle plus a few jiffies. In

+	 *
+	 * To introduce this case, we can note that allowing the drive
+	 * to enqueue more than one request at a time, and hence
+	 * delegating de facto final scheduling decisions to the
+	 * drive's internal scheduler, entails loss of control on the
+	 * actual request service order. In particular, the critical
+	 * situation is when requests from different processes happen
+	 * to be present, at the same time, in the internal queue(s)
+	 * of the drive. In such a situation, the drive, by deciding
+	 * the service order of the internally-queued requests, does
+	 * determine also the actual throughput distribution among
+	 * these processes. But the drive typically has no notion or
+	 * concern about per-process throughput distribution, and
+	 * makes its decisions only on a per-request basis. Therefore,
+	 * the service distribution enforced by the drive's internal
+	 * scheduler is likely to coincide with the desired
+	 * device-throughput distribution only in a completely
+	 * symmetric scenario where:
+	 * (i)  each of these processes must get the same throughput as
+	 *      the others;
+	 * (ii) all these processes have the same I/O pattern
+	 *      (either sequential or random).
+	 * In fact, in such a scenario, the drive will tend to treat
+	 * the requests of each of these processes in about the same
+	 * way as the requests of the others, and thus to provide
+	 * each of these processes with about the same throughput
+	 * (which is exactly the desired throughput distribution). In
+	 * contrast, in any asymmetric scenario, device idling is
+	 * certainly needed to guarantee that bfqq receives its
+	 * assigned fraction of the device throughput (see [1] for
+	 * details).
+	 *
+	 * We address this issue by controlling, actually, only the
+	 * symmetry sub-condition (i), i.e., provided that
+	 * sub-condition (i) holds, idling is not performed,
+	 * regardless of whether sub-condition (ii) holds. In other
+	 * words, only if sub-condition (i) holds, then idling is
+	 * allowed, and the device tends to be prevented from queueing
+	 * many requests, possibly of several processes. The reason
+	 * for not controlling also sub-condition (ii) is that we
+	 * exploit preemption to preserve guarantees in case of
+	 * symmetric scenarios, even if (ii) does not hold, as
+	 * explained in the next two paragraphs.
+	 *
+	 * Even if a queue, say Q, is expired when it remains idle, Q
+	 * can still preempt the new in-service queue if the next
+	 * request of Q arrives soon (see the comments on
+	 * bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation). If all queues and
+	 * groups have the same weight, this form of preemption,
+	 * combined with the hole-recovery heuristic described in the
+	 * comments on function bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation,
+	 * are enough to preserve a correct bandwidth distribution in
+	 * the mid term, even without idling. In fact, even if not
+	 * idling allows the internal queues of the device to contain
+	 * many requests, and thus to reorder requests, we can rather
+	 * safely assume that the internal scheduler still preserves a
+	 * minimum of mid-term fairness. The motivation for using
+	 * preemption instead of idling is that, by not idling,
+	 * service guarantees are preserved without minimally
+	 * sacrificing throughput. In other words, both a high
+	 * throughput and its desired distribution are obtained.
+	 *
+	 * More precisely, this preemption-based, idleless approach
+	 * provides fairness in terms of IOPS, and not sectors per
+	 * second. This can be seen with a simple example. Suppose
+	 * that there are two queues with the same weight, but that
+	 * the first queue receives requests of 8 sectors, while the
+	 * second queue receives requests of 1024 sectors. In
+	 * addition, suppose that each of the two queues contains at
+	 * most one request at a time, which implies that each queue
+	 * always remains idle after it is served. Finally, after
+	 * remaining idle, each queue receives very quickly a new
+	 * request. It follows that the two queues are served
+	 * alternatively, preempting each other if needed. This
+	 * implies that, although both queues have the same weight,
+	 * the queue with large requests receives a service that is
+	 * 1024/8 times as high as the service received by the other
+	 * queue.
+	 *
+	 * On the other hand, device idling is performed, and thus
+	 * pure sector-domain guarantees are provided, for the
+	 * following queues, which are likely to need stronger
+	 * throughput guarantees: weight-raised queues, and queues
+	 * with a higher weight than other queues. When such queues
+	 * are active, sub-condition (i) is false, which triggers
+	 * device idling.
+	 *
+	 * According to the above considerations, the next variable is
+	 * true (only) if sub-condition (i) holds. To compute the
+	 * value of this variable, we not only use the return value of
+	 * the function bfq_symmetric_scenario(), but also check
+	 * whether bfqq is being weight-raised, because
+	 * bfq_symmetric_scenario() does not take into account also
+	 * weight-raised queues (see comments on
+	 * bfq_weights_tree_add()).
+	 *
+	 * As a side note, it is worth considering that the above
+	 * device-idling countermeasures may however fail in the
+	 * following unlucky scenario: if idling is (correctly)
+	 * disabled in a time period during which all symmetry
+	 * sub-conditions hold, and hence the device is allowed to
+	 * enqueue many requests, but at some later point in time some
+	 * sub-condition stops to hold, then it may become impossible
+	 * to let requests be served in the desired order until all

+ * that will be served next, if 1) no changes in the schedule occurs
+ * before the current in-service entity is expired, 2) the in-service

+ * of the entity pointed by in_service_entity becomes idle on

+ * BFQ is a proportional-share I/O scheduler, with some extra
+ * low-latency capabilities. BFQ also supports full hierarchical
+ * scheduling through cgroups. Next paragraphs provide an introduction
+ * on BFQ inner workings. Details on BFQ benefits and usage can be
+ * found in Documentation/block/bfq-iosched.txt.
+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share storage-I/O scheduling algorithm based
+ * on the slice-by-slice service scheme of CFQ. But BFQ assigns
+ * budgets, measured in number of sectors, to processes instead of
+ * time slices. The device is not granted to the in-service process
+ * for a given time slice, but until it has exhausted its assigned
+ * budget. This change from the time to the service domain enables BFQ
+ * to distribute the device throughput among processes as desired,
+ * without any distortion due to throughput fluctuations, or to device
+ * internal queueing. BFQ uses an ad hoc internal scheduler, called
+ * B-WF2Q+, to schedule processes according to their budgets. More
+ * precisely, BFQ schedules queues associated with processes. Thanks to
+ * the accurate policy of B-WF2Q+, BFQ can afford to assign high
+ * budgets to I/O-bound processes issuing sequential requests (to
+ * boost the throughput), and yet guarantee a low latency to

+ * R and T are two reference parameters.
+ * In particular, R is the peak rate of the reference device (see below),
+ * and T is a reference time: given the systems that are likely to be
+ * installed on the reference device according to its speed class, T is
+ * about the maximum time needed, under BFQ and while reading two files in
+ * parallel, to load typical large applications on these systems.
+ * In practice, the slower/faster the device at hand is, the more/less it
+ * takes to load applications with respect to the reference device.
+ * Accordingly, the longer/shorter BFQ grants weight raising to interactive
+ * applications.
+ *
+ * BFQ uses four different reference pairs (R, T), depending on:
+ * . whether the device is rotational or non-rotational;
+ * . whether the device is slow, such as old or portable HDDs, as well as
+ *   SD cards, or fast, such as newer HDDs and SSDs.
+ *
+ * The device's speed class is dynamically (re)detected in
+ * bfq_update_peak_rate() every time the estimated peak rate is updated.
+ *
+ * In the following definitions, R_slow[0]/R_fast[0] and
+ * T_slow[0]/T_fast[0] are the reference values for a slow/fast
+ * rotational device, whereas R_slow[1]/R_fast[1] and
+ * T_slow[1]/T_fast[1] are the reference values for a slow/fast
+ * non-rotational device. Finally, device_speed_thresh are the
+ * thresholds used to switch between speed classes. The reference
+ * rates are not the actual peak rates of the devices used as a
+ * reference, but slightly lower values. The reason for using these
+ * slightly lower values is that the peak-rate estimator tends to
+ * yield slightly lower values than the actual peak rate (it can yield
+ * the actual peak rate only if there is only one process doing I/O,
+ * and the process does sequential I/O).

+ * If many queues belonging to the same group happen to be created
+ * shortly after each other, then the processes associated with these
+ * queues have typically a common goal. In particular, bursts of queue
+ * creations are usually caused by services or applications that spawn
+ * many parallel threads/processes. Examples are systemd during boot,
+ * or git grep. To help these processes get their job done as soon as
+ * possible, it is usually better to not grant either weight-raising
+ * or device idling to their queues.
+ *
+ * In this comment we describe, firstly, the reasons why this fact
+ * holds, and, secondly, the next function, which implements the main
+ * steps needed to properly mark these queues so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way.
+ *
+ * The above services or applications benefit mostly from a high
+ * throughput: the quicker the requests of the activated queues are
+ * cumulatively served, the sooner the target job of these queues gets
+ * completed. As a consequence, weight-raising any of these queues,
+ * which also implies idling the device for it, is almost always
+ * counterproductive. In most cases it just lowers throughput.
+ *
+ * On the other hand, a burst of queue creations may be caused also by
+ * the start of an application that does not consist of a lot of
+ * parallel I/O-bound threads. In fact, with a complex application,
+ * several short processes may need to be executed to start-up the
+ * application. In this respect, to start an application as quickly as
+ * possible, the best thing to do is in any case to privilege the I/O
+ * related to the application with respect to all other
+ * I/O. Therefore, the best strategy to start as quickly as possible
+ * an application that causes a burst of queue creations is to
+ * weight-raise all the queues created during the burst. This is the
+ * exact opposite of the best strategy for the other type of bursts.
+ *
+ * In the end, to take the best action for each of the two cases, the
+ * two types of bursts need to be distinguished. Fortunately, this
+ * seems relatively easy, by looking at the sizes of the bursts. In
+ * particular, we found a threshold such that only bursts with a
+ * larger size than that threshold are apparently caused by
+ * services or commands such as systemd or git grep. For brevity,
+ * hereafter we call just 'large' these bursts. BFQ *does not*
+ * weight-raise queues whose creation occurs in a large burst. In
+ * addition, for each of these queues BFQ performs or does not perform
+ * idling depending on which choice boosts the throughput more. The
+ * exact choice depends on the device and request pattern at
+ * hand.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, false positives may occur while an interactive task
+ * is starting (e.g., an application is being started). The
+ * consequence is that the queues associated with the task do not
+ * enjoy weight raising as expected. Fortunately these false positives
+ * are very rare. They typically occur if some service happens to
+ * start doing I/O exactly when the interactive task starts.
+ *
+ * Turning back to the next function, it implements all the steps
+ * needed to detect the occurrence of a large burst and to properly
+ * mark all the queues belonging to it (so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way). This goal is achieved by maintaining a
+ * "burst list" that holds, temporarily, the queues that belong to the
+ * burst in progress. The list is then used to mark these queues as
+ * belonging to a large burst if the burst does become large. The main
+ * steps are the following.
+ *
+ * . when the very first queue is created, the queue is inserted into the
+ *   list (as it could be the first queue in a possible burst)
+ *
+ * . if the current burst has not yet become large, and a queue Q that does
+ *   not yet belong to the burst is activated shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a new queue entered the burst list, then the function appends
+ *   Q to the burst list
+ *
+ * . if, as a consequence of the previous step, the burst size reaches
+ *   the large-burst threshold, then
+ *
+ *     . all the queues in the burst list are marked as belonging to a
+ *       large burst
+ *
+ *     . the burst list is deleted; in fact, the burst list already served
+ *       its purpose (keeping temporarily track of the queues in a burst,
+ *       so as to be able to mark them as belonging to a large burst in the
+ *       previous sub-step), and now is not needed any more
+ *
+ *     . the device enters a large-burst mode
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created while
+ *   the device is in large-burst mode and shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a queue either entered the burst list or was marked as
+ *   belonging to the current large burst, then Q is immediately marked
+ *   as belonging to a large burst.
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created a while
+ *   later, i.e., not shortly after, than the last time at which a queue
+ *   either entered the burst list or was marked as belonging to the
+ *   current large burst, then the current burst is deemed as finished and:
+ *
+ *        . the large-burst mode is reset if set
+ *
+ *        . the burst list is emptied
+ *
+ *        . Q is inserted in the burst list, as Q may be the first queue
+ *          in a possible new burst (then the burst list contains just Q
+ *          after this step).

+/*
+ * The next function, invoked after the input queue bfqq switches from
+ * idle to busy, updates the budget of bfqq. The function also tells
+ * whether the in-service queue should be expired, by returning
+ * true. The purpose of expiring the in-service queue is to give bfqq
+ * the chance to possibly preempt the in-service queue, and the reason
+ * for preempting the in-service queue is to achieve one of the two
+ * goals below.
+ *
+ * 1. Guarantee to bfqq its reserved bandwidth even if bfqq has
+ * expired because it has remained idle. In particular, bfqq may have
+ * expired for one of the following two reasons:
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_NO_MORE_REQUEST bfqq did not enjoy any device idling and
+ *   did not make it to issue a new request before its last request
+ *   was served;
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_TOO_IDLE bfqq did enjoy device idling, but did not issue
+ *   a new request before the expiration of the idling-time.
+ *
+ * Even if bfqq has expired for one of the above reasons, the process
+ * associated with the queue may be however issuing requests greedily,
+ * and thus be sensitive to the bandwidth it receives (bfqq may have
+ * remained idle for other reasons: CPU high load, bfqq not enjoying
+ * idling, I/O throttling somewhere in the path from the process to
+ * the I/O scheduler, ...). But if, after every expiration for one of
+ * the above two reasons, bfqq has to wait for the service of at least
+ * one full budget of another queue before being served again, then
+ * bfqq is likely to get a much lower bandwidth or resource time than
+ * its reserved ones. To address this issue, two countermeasures need
+ * to be taken.
+ *
+ * First, the budget and the timestamps of bfqq need to be updated in
+ * a special way on bfqq reactivation: they need to be updated as if
+ * bfqq did not remain idle and did not expire. In fact, if they are
+ * computed as if bfqq expired and remained idle until reactivation,
+ * then the process associated with bfqq is treated as if, instead of
+ * being greedy, it stopped issuing requests when bfqq remained idle,
+ * and restarts issuing requests only on this reactivation. In other
+ * words, the scheduler does not help the process recover the "service
+ * hole" between bfqq expiration and reactivation. As a consequence,
+ * the process receives a lower bandwidth than its reserved one. In
+ * contrast, to recover this hole, the budget must be updated as if
+ * bfqq was not expired at all before this reactivation, i.e., it must
+ * be set to the value of the remaining budget when bfqq was
+ * expired. Along the same line, timestamps need to be assigned the
+ * value they had the last time bfqq was selected for service, i.e.,
+ * before last expiration. Thus timestamps need to be back-shifted
+ * with respect to their normal computation (see [1] for more details
+ * on this tricky aspect).
+ *
+ * Secondly, to allow the process to recover the hole, the in-service
+ * queue must be expired too, to give bfqq the chance to preempt it
+ * immediately. In fact, if bfqq has to wait for a full budget of the
+ * in-service queue to be completed, then it may become impossible to
+ * let the process recover the hole, even if the back-shifted
+ * timestamps of bfqq are lower than those of the in-service queue. If
+ * this happens for most or all of the holes, then the process may not
+ * receive its reserved bandwidth. In this respect, it is worth noting
+ * that, being the service of outstanding requests unpreemptible, a
+ * little fraction of the holes may however be unrecoverable, thereby
+ * causing a little loss of bandwidth.
+ *
+ * The last important point is detecting whether bfqq does need this
+ * bandwidth recovery. In this respect, the next function deems the
+ * process associated with bfqq greedy, and thus allows it to recover
+ * the hole, if: 1) the process is waiting for the arrival of a new
+ * request (which implies that bfqq expired for one of the above two
+ * reasons), and 2) such a request has arrived soon. The first
+ * condition is controlled through the flag non_blocking_wait_rq,
+ * while the second through the flag arrived_in_time. If both
+ * conditions hold, then the function computes the budget in the
+ * above-described special way, and signals that the in-service queue
+ * should be expired. Timestamp back-shifting is done later in
+ * __bfq_activate_entity.
+ *
+ * 2. Reduce latency. Even if timestamps are not backshifted to let
+ * the process associated with bfqq recover a service hole, bfqq may
+ * however happen to have, after being (re)activated, a lower finish
+ * timestamp than the in-service queue.  That is, the next budget of
+ * bfqq may have to be completed before the one of the in-service
+ * queue. If this is the case, then preempting the in-service queue
+ * allows this goal to be achieved, apart from the unpreemptible,
+ * outstanding requests mentioned above.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, regardless of which of the above two goals one wants
+ * to achieve, service trees need first to be updated to know whether
+ * the in-service queue must be preempted. To have service trees
+ * correctly updated, the in-service queue must be expired and
+ * rescheduled, and bfqq must be scheduled too. This is one of the
+ * most costly operations (in future versions, the scheduling
+ * mechanism may be re-designed in such a way to make it possible to
+ * know whether preemption is needed without needing to update service
+ * trees). In addition, queue preemptions almost always cause random
+ * I/O, and thus loss of throughput. Because of these facts, the next
+ * function adopts the following simple scheme to avoid both costly
+ * operations and too frequent preemptions: it requests the expiration
+ * of the in-service queue (unconditionally) only for queues that need
+ * to recover a hole, or that either are weight-raised or deserve to
+ * be weight-raised.

+ * batch, to compute the next-start time instant, soft_rt_next_start, such
+ * that, if the next request of the application does not arrive before
+ * soft_rt_next_start, then the above requirement on the bandwidth is met.
+ *
+ * The second requirement is that the request pattern of the application is
+ * isochronous, i.e., that, after issuing a request or a batch of requests,
+ * the application stops issuing new requests until all its pending requests
+ * have been completed. After that, the application may issue a new batch,
+ * and so on.
+ * For this reason the next function is invoked to compute
+ * soft_rt_next_start only for applications that meet this requirement,
+ * whereas soft_rt_next_start is set to infinity for applications that do
+ * not.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, even a greedy application may happen to behave in an
+ * isochronous way if the CPU load is high. In fact, the application may
+ * stop issuing requests while the CPUs are busy serving other processes,
+ * then restart, then stop again for a while, and so on. In addition, if
+ * the disk achieves a low enough throughput with the request pattern
+ * issued by the application (e.g., because the request pattern is random
+ * and/or the device is slow), then the application may meet the above
+ * bandwidth requirement too. To prevent such a greedy application to be
+ * deemed as soft real-time, a further rule is used in the computation of
+ * soft_rt_next_start: soft_rt_next_start must be higher than the current
+ * time plus the maximum time for which the arrival of a request is waited
+ * for when a sync queue becomes idle, namely bfqd->bfq_slice_idle.
+ * This filters out greedy applications, as the latter issue instead their
+ * next request as soon as possible after the last one has been completed
+ * (in contrast, when a batch of requests is completed, a soft real-time
+ * application spends some time processing data).
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, the last filter may easily generate false positives if

+ * or both the following cases occur:
+ * 1) HZ is so low that the duration of a jiffy is comparable to or higher
+ *    than bfqd->bfq_slice_idle. This happens, e.g., on slow devices with
+ *    HZ=100.
+ * 2) jiffies, instead of increasing at a constant rate, may stop increasing
+ *    for a while, then suddenly 'jump' by several units to recover the lost
+ *    increments. This seems to happen, e.g., inside virtual machines.
+ * To address this issue, we do not use as a reference time interval just
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, but bfqd->bfq_slice_idle plus a few jiffies. In

+	 * delegating de facto final scheduling decisions to the
+	 * drive's internal scheduler, entails loss of control on the

+	 * to be present, at the same time, in the internal queue(s)
+	 * of the drive. In such a situation, the drive, by deciding
+	 * the service order of the internally-queued requests, does
+	 * determine also the actual throughput distribution among
+	 * these processes. But the drive typically has no notion or
+	 * concern about per-process throughput distribution, and
+	 * makes its decisions only on a per-request basis. Therefore,
+	 * the service distribution enforced by the drive's internal
+	 * scheduler is likely to coincide with the desired
+	 * device-throughput distribution only in a completely
+	 * symmetric scenario where:
+	 * (i)  each of these processes must get the same throughput as
+	 *      the others;
+	 * (ii) all these processes have the same I/O pattern
+	 *      (either sequential or random).
+	 * In fact, in such a scenario, the drive will tend to treat
+	 * the requests of each of these processes in about the same
+	 * way as the requests of the others, and thus to provide
+	 * each of these processes with about the same throughput
+	 * (which is exactly the desired throughput distribution). In
+	 * contrast, in any asymmetric scenario, device idling is
+	 * certainly needed to guarantee that bfqq receives its
+	 * assigned fraction of the device throughput (see [1] for
+	 * details).
+	 *
+	 * We address this issue by controlling, actually, only the
+	 * symmetry sub-condition (i), i.e., provided that
+	 * sub-condition (i) holds, idling is not performed,
+	 * regardless of whether sub-condition (ii) holds. In other
+	 * words, only if sub-condition (i) holds, then idling is
+	 * allowed, and the device tends to be prevented from queueing
+	 * many requests, possibly of several processes. The reason
+	 * for not controlling also sub-condition (ii) is that we
+	 * exploit preemption to preserve guarantees in case of
+	 * symmetric scenarios, even if (ii) does not hold, as
+	 * explained in the next two paragraphs.
+	 *
+	 * Even if a queue, say Q, is expired when it remains idle, Q
+	 * can still preempt the new in-service queue if the next
+	 * request of Q arrives soon (see the comments on
+	 * bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation). If all queues and
+	 * groups have the same weight, this form of preemption,
+	 * combined with the hole-recovery heuristic described in the
+	 * comments on function bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation,
+	 * are enough to preserve a correct bandwidth distribution in
+	 * the mid term, even without idling. In fact, even if not
+	 * idling allows the internal queues of the device to contain
+	 * many requests, and thus to reorder requests, we can rather
+	 * safely assume that the internal scheduler still preserves a
+	 * minimum of mid-term fairness. The motivation for using
+	 * preemption instead of idling is that, by not idling,
+	 * service guarantees are preserved without minimally
+	 * sacrificing throughput. In other words, both a high
+	 * throughput and its desired distribution are obtained.
+	 *
+	 * More precisely, this preemption-based, idleless approach
+	 * provides fairness in terms of IOPS, and not sectors per
+	 * second. This can be seen with a simple example. Suppose
+	 * that there are two queues with the same weight, but that
+	 * the first queue receives requests of 8 sectors, while the
+	 * second queue receives requests of 1024 sectors. In
+	 * addition, suppose that each of the two queues contains at
+	 * most one request at a time, which implies that each queue
+	 * always remains idle after it is served. Finally, after
+	 * remaining idle, each queue receives very quickly a new
+	 * request. It follows that the two queues are served
+	 * alternatively, preempting each other if needed. This
+	 * implies that, although both queues have the same weight,
+	 * the queue with large requests receives a service that is
+	 * 1024/8 times as high as the service received by the other
+	 * queue.
+	 *
+	 * On the other hand, device idling is performed, and thus
+	 * pure sector-domain guarantees are provided, for the
+	 * following queues, which are likely to need stronger
+	 * throughput guarantees: weight-raised queues, and queues
+	 * with a higher weight than other queues. When such queues
+	 * are active, sub-condition (i) is false, which triggers
+	 * device idling.
+	 *
+	 * According to the above considerations, the next variable is
+	 * true (only) if sub-condition (i) holds. To compute the
+	 * value of this variable, we not only use the return value of
+	 * the function bfq_symmetric_scenario(), but also check
+	 * whether bfqq is being weight-raised, because
+	 * bfq_symmetric_scenario() does not take into account also
+	 * weight-raised queues (see comments on
+	 * bfq_weights_tree_add()).
+	 *
+	 * As a side note, it is worth considering that the above
+	 * device-idling countermeasures may however fail in the
+	 * following unlucky scenario: if idling is (correctly)
+	 * disabled in a time period during which all symmetry
+	 * sub-conditions hold, and hence the device is allowed to
+	 * enqueue many requests, but at some later point in time some

Subject: [PATCH 19/26] elevator: allow name aliases

Since we now lookup elevator types with the appropriate multiqueue
capability, allow schedulers to register with an alias alongside
the real name. This is in preparation for allowing 'mq-deadline'
to register an alias of 'deadline' as well.
